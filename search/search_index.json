Note, these are not complete and accepted formal definitions. </p> <p>Computer (historical) - At its most basic, \"a thing that computes\"; originally referred to humans who would sit at desks and do repeated numerical calculations for businesses and institutions.</p> <p>Digital Computer - Modern devices that use discrete numbers to symbolically represent information and perform operations on that data using a finite set of general operations. Made of transistors that form logic gates.</p> <p>Analog Computer - Devices that model predetermined calculations through the use of voltage, gears, pulleys, or other phenomenon that is related to the calculation in question.</p> <p>Purpose Built - A characteristic of analog computers meaning they cannot be reprogrammed and must have their purpose defined beforehand.</p> <p>Transistor - Small electrical components that can either block or allow passage of an electrical signal depending on whether itself is being fed an electrical signal. Used to make logic gates in modern computers.</p> <p>Universal Turing Machine - A theoretical general-purpose computer proposed by Alan Turing in 1936, capable of computing anything that is computable by executing instructions stored in memory.</p> <p>Turing-complete - A device that can simulate a Turing machine by being able to: read and write data to memory, perform conditional branching, loop or repeat operations, and have the possibility of infinite memory.</p> <p>Bit - The smallest unit of information, having two states (on and off) that map directly to True and False, 1 and 0.</p> <p>Logic Gates - Components built from transistors that use boolean algebra; they bridge the gap between natural electrical phenomenon and more complex computing systems.</p> <p>Abstraction Hierarchy - Layered diagrams used by computer scientists to organize the many logical structures that build on top of one another in a computer system, from electronics/physics up to applications.</p> <p>Von Neumann Architecture (Von Neumann Model) - The main architecture used for modern computers, organizing logic gates into components with concrete purposes to build a general computing platform. Falls at the \"Micro Architecture\" layer of the abstraction hierarchy.</p> <p>Central Processing Unit (CPU) - The main computational workhorse that reads machine instructions and executes them. Made of two parts: the Control Unit and Arithmetic/Logic Unit.</p> <p>Control Unit - Part of the CPU used to sequence operations to be performed by the machine, orchestrating the other components.</p> <p>Arithmetic/Logic Unit - Part of the CPU used to perform the instructions from the control unit on the memory unit.</p> <p>Memory Unit - A bank of memory that stores both instructions and data in the same address space.</p> <p>Input Device - The source of information into the CPU, can be new instructions or data.</p> <p>Output Device - Receives information from the CPU and routes it to other devices for control signals.</p> <p>Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) - Defines what instructions exist for the CPU to execute; these instructions are what become machine code.</p> <p>Machine Code - The individual instructions executed by the CPU, stored and read in raw binary.</p> <p>Assembly Language - A system of writing CPU instructions using human-readable identifiers (characters that relate to the instruction's purpose) instead of raw binary, making direct communication with the CPU easier.</p> <p>Assembler - A program that can convert assembly code into binary machine code that the CPU can understand and execute.</p>"},{"location":"schedule/","title":"Schedule","text":""},{"location":"schedule/#disclaimer","title":"DISCLAIMER","text":"<p>This schedule will be primarily used as a history of topics that we have covered thus far, as well as a short look into the future.

To demonstrate the overall, big-picture view of a computer and working at these different conceptual layers, computer scientists often use layered abstraction diagrams to organize the many logical structures that build on top of one another.</p> <p></p> <p>In this Abstraction Hierarchy, we can see that working at the application layer is most abstract from what is actually happening at the physical level. Rarely do we ever need to worry about overflowing a memory register when playing Minecraft or Word. Most of the time, as programmers, we work within the \"Programming Language\" and \"Algorithm\" layers, since this is where software development takes place. However, in order to interact with the computer in such a way there are a lot of steps that need to happen before we get to use <code>printf()</code>. </p> <p>At the bottom of the hierarchy is \"Electronics and Physics\", these are the natural laws that we harness to represent information. If it was not for the way that electricity flows through wires and our intelligent manipulation of it, the modern computer would not exist. Electricity is not the only method of representing computation, in fact we are trying to find new ways of accomplishing computation:</p> <ul> <li>Quantum Computers - Using quantum particles to represent computation</li> <li>Optical Computing - A growing research field in unconventional computation methods is using light to store and operate on data</li> <li>DNA Computing - The very programming language our body runs on can be harnessed to run many repeated operations in a fraction of the time it takes for electronic based computers, although very specialized and very difficult to read the results at the end</li> </ul> <p>The main way we channel electricity to compute is by use of transistors and other electronics components. Transistors are essentially electrical switches that are themselves controlled by an electric signal. They function like this:</p> <p></p> <p>Transistors have two states, on and off, giving the smallest unit of information, a bit. On and off map directly to True and False, allowing a critical connection to boolean algebra and enabling the construction of logic gates. These logic gates are a bridge that facilitate building more complex systems from the natural phenomenon of electricity. These logic gates are used to build systems that allow for arithmetic to be done using binary numbers, store memory, and control other parts of the computers architecture. Each one of these components are organized according to a computer architecture to form the central processing unit (CPU).

These instructions are what the CPU will execute at the end of the day and is called machine code. Each individual instruction must be carefully picked and designed to be as fundamental as possible so that further functionalities can be built on top of them without later alteration. The two most popular instruction set architectures that you may know are:</p> <ul> <li>Intel's x86-64 instruction set - The current industry standard instruction set for most consumer PCs. Originally designed to only handle 32-bit length numbers (x86), but was later updated to support 64-bit numbers (x86-64). Owned by Intel, must pay them to create chips with it.</li> <li>RISC-V (\"risk-five\") - Reduced, optimized instruction set that sees use for environments where computational resources are constrained. Less widely used, but recently has seen more adoption. Open-sourced.</li> </ul> <p>This machine code is stored and read by the CPU in raw binary in order to be \"understood\". However, writing programs in raw binary is nearly impossible for a human to do in a reasonable amount of time. To make direct communication with the CPU easier, each machine code instruction was given an identifier written in characters that related to it purpose and a system of writing these more human-readable instructions into programs was developed, resulting in the creation of the Assembly Language.</p> <p></p> <p>Assembly language made it easier to develop programs, however the instructions were now no longer in a form that the CPU could understand. The CPU directly read instructions as binary codes, and as a result all instructions that intend to be ran must be in that form. This necessitated the creation of the assembler, a program that can convert assembly code into binary machine code. </p> <p>This idea of creating a level of representation on top of what you are actually doing on the computer for ease of use and development is yet another example of abstraction and working up the hierarchy. Every level above builds on top of assembly in some way, making it the lowest level of abstraction we as programmers can interact with normally. This puts it in a special place, an eventuality that every language designer and chip manufacturer should respect. As a result of this importance, it will be one of the focuses of this course and will be programmed in by the end of the semester.</p> <p>From assembly we build all other programming languages, for the purposes of this course we will focus on the C programming language primarily. This is due to the fact that C preserves certain low-level access that other languages hide away. C allows for direct memory access and its compilations object that are in assembly and machine code as easy to access.

This makes development faster since you can test code quickly, but execution tends to be slower since the machine instructions are not always written in the most efficient manner out-of-the-box.</p> <p>Compiled languages, like C and C++, accomplish this task in a different way. Instead of being executed by and interpreter at runtime, C programs are compiled and converted to low-level machine code before runtime. Essentially, compiled languages are translated into machine code at compile time for the target system to produce an executable that can be ran without recompilation or interpretation. This leads to faster programs and more fine-grained control over what happens during the course of your program</p> <p>This process involves four primary steps:</p> <ol> <li>Preprocessing: The C preprocessor (CPP) formats the source code using macros like <code>#include</code> or <code>#define</code>, applying any user-defined changes before passing to the next step</li> <li>Compilation: The compiler translates C source code into assembly language</li> <li>Assembly: The assembler then converts the assembly code into machine code, producing object files, <code>.o</code> or <code>.obj</code>, as a result</li> <li>Linking: The linker orders the object files properly and combines them into a single executable program that is ready to run on the target system</li> </ol> <p>The following are the commands to compile a simple C program, using the GNU C Compiler: <pre><code># Compile source.c into an executable named program\ngcc source.c -o program\n# Run the executable\n./program\n</code></pre> In this simple program, all of the main steps are hidden from the user, however we can use compiler flags to view some of the intermediate files:</p> <ul> <li><code>-E</code>: Stops after preprocessing stage</li> <li><code>-S</code>: Stops compilation after generating assembly code</li> <li><code>-c</code>: Stops compilation after generating object files, preventing linking</li> </ul>"},{"location":"lessons/2_reviewing_c/#basics","title":"Basics","text":"<p>Now that we have reviewed how to compile and run our programs, let's go over the the fundamental building blocks of C programming.</p> <p>The following is a standard \"Hello World!\" program written in C: <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\nint main(int argc, const char* argv[])\n{\n    printf(\"Hello CS240!\\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre></p> <ol> <li><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</code> - This is a preprocessor macro to include the <code>stdio.h</code> file at the beginning of this source code file.</li> <li><code>int main(){}</code> - The main function, our main entry point into executing code on the computer.
