When you run a Python script, the interpreter reads each line, translates it to machine instructions, and executes it immediately. This makes development faster since you can test code quickly, but execution tends to be slower since the machine instructions are not always written in the most efficient manner out-of-the-box.</p> <p>Compiled languages, like C and C++, accomplish this task in a different way. Instead of being executed by and interpreter at runtime, C programs are compiled and converted to low-level machine code before runtime. Essentially, compiled languages are translated into machine code at compile time for the target system to produce an executable that can be ran without recompilation or interpretation. This leads to faster programs and more fine-grained control over what happens during the course of your program</p> <p>This process involves four primary steps:</p> <ol> <li>Preprocessing: The C preprocessor (CPP) formats the source code using macros like <code>#include</code> or <code>#define</code>, applying any user-defined changes before passing to the next step</li> <li>Compilation: The compiler translates C source code into assembly language</li> <li>Assembly: The assembler then converts the assembly code into machine code, producing object files, <code>.o</code> or <code>.obj</code>, as a result</li> <li>Linking: The linker orders the object files properly and combines them into a single executable program that is ready to run on the target system</li> </ol> <p>The following are the commands to compile a simple C program, using the GNU C Compiler: <pre><code># Compile source.c into an executable named program\ngcc source.c -o program\n# Run the executable\n./program\n</code></pre> In this simple program, all of the main steps are hidden from the user, however we can use compiler flags to view some of the intermediate files:</p> <ul> <li><code>-E</code>: Stops after preprocessing stage</li> <li><code>-S</code>: Stops compilation after generating assembly code</li> <li><code>-c</code>: Stops compilation after generating object files, preventing linking</li> </ul>"},{"location":"lessons/2_reviewing_c/#basics","title":"Basics","text":"<p>Now that we have reviewed how to compile and run our programs, let's go over the the fundamental building blocks of C programming.</p> <p>The following is a standard \"Hello World!\" program written in C: <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\nint main(int argc, const char* argv[])\n{\n    printf(\"Hello CS240!\\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre></p> <ol> <li><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</code> - This is a preprocessor macro to include the <code>stdio.h</code> file at the beginning of this source code file.</li> <li><code>int main(){}</code> - The main function, our main entry point into executing code on the computer. The compiler runs this function in the final executable, making it responsible for orchestrating  all other functions.</li> <li><code>(int argc, const char* argv[])</code> - Command line arguments. When you run the program in the command-line, you may optionally give additional parameters to feed into your program, for example: <code>./program argument1 argument2</code>. <code>argc</code> and <code>argv</code> are variables that contain information about the command-line arguments. <code>argc</code><ol> <li><code>argc</code> - the number of arguments, including the filename of the executable<ol> <li>In the example above, it would take on the value 3</li> </ol> </li> <li><code>argv</code> - an array of char*'s to the actual string parameters passed</li> </ol> </li> <li><code>printf(\"Hello CS240!\\n\");</code> - This line represents a statement in C, an individual line of code. All statements in C must end in a semicolon <code>;</code>. This specific statement is calling a function from <code>stdio.h</code>, <code>printf();</code> which allows the programmer to print information to the screen.</li> <li><code>return 0;</code> - The return statement. When we defined <code>main();</code>, we put an <code>int</code> identifier before the function identifier. This defines the return type that is expected from our function, which is enforced by the compiler.
