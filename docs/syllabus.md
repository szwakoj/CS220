## Course Catalog Description:
Introduces students to the organization and architecture of computer systems as a hierarchy of levels, beginning with the standard von Neumann model and then moving forward to more recent architectural concepts. Topics include digital logic, microprogramming, conventional machine and assembly language levels. Emphasis is given to those aspects of computer hardware that effect programming. Prerequisite: CS 108
## Course Objectives:
- Give a high-level overview of the organization and architecture of computer systems
- Introduce students to the concept of abstraction in both problem solving and computer systems
- Cover the von Neuman Architecture
- Teach students the binary number system, boolean logic, and digital logic
- Have students program in Assembly and other low-level machine languages
- Show the intersection of computer hardware and software

## Student Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course you will:

 - Understand the concept of abstraction
 - Be able to explain the Hierarchy of Abstraction in computers and understand which level you are working in
 - Know the general organizational and architectural concepts of computer systems at multiple levels
 - Convert numbers between binary, decimal, and hexadecimal number systems
 - Use basic boolean algebra and k-maps to understand digital logic
 - Design basic circuits using logic gates
 - Understand how transistors are used to built up to more complex systems
 - Create your own Fetch-Decode-Execute systems
 - Simulate/Emulate simple CPU processes using bit manipulation in the C programming language
 - Code in Assembly and other low-level instruction sets

## Text and Materials:

There is no required text book, most if not all material will be through this site and in class lectures. There are, however suggested resources for those who learn best with a textbook as reference, as well as the sources for the course.


"Digital Design and Computer Architecture" by Harris and Harris 

- Textbook that covers a lot of the early information of this course, we will not be covering it exhaustively

- Not required

## Course Schedule:

Below is the rough topical structure of the course in the order of coverage, you can find this plan and the most updated schedule at the course website. The schedule is a rough outline and will be changed to best serve the classes needs, any changes made will be in favor of the students and any complications can be rectified over email or in-person.


These units are a rough organization of the topics in the order covered, they will be about 2-3 weeks each with some time allotted for tests and review. More or less time could be taken depending on the class pace, the latter allowing for more topics to be covered.

- Unit Order
	- Introduction
	- Basic Computer Organization
	- Binary and Digital Logic
	- Circuits, Multiplexers, and Decoders
	- Instruction Set Architectures and Assembly

## Content Accessibility

SUNY Poly’s goal is for all digital content to be fully accessible but there may be times when remediation is still underway, please let me know if you experience challenges accessing any digital content in this course.

This course is attempting to start a new standard for the CS department using open-source tools to make content universally accessible according to any accessibility requirements by producing all content sources in Markdown. By creating it in Markdown and pure text, any accessibility reader can be tooled to a students needs, while allowing for the teacher to rapidly create material in a lasting way.

This process will not be without its bumps, so, if there are any issues with accessing the course material or reading it in any way, please contact me ASAP by email at szwakoj@sunypoly.edu.

The Writing and Communications Center (WCC) is here to support all of SUNY Poly’s writers: students, faculty, and staff. We offer one-on-one in-person and remote consultations for writers working on a range of projects at any stage of the writing process (from idea generation to final revisions). WCC consultants work with writers on idea development, brainstorming, content development, structure, source use, style, grammar, punctuation, and more. While we are not a proofreading or editing service and we do not comment on grades, we offer strategies and resources writers can use as they compose, revise, edit, and learn to proofread their own work. The WCC is located on the first floor of the Cayan Library. You can learn more about the WCC or make an appointment by visiting our website: https://sunypoly.edu/writingcenter.html.

## Plagiarism Warning

All homeworks, quizzes, tests, and labs are meant to be completed by students independently (unless otherwise stated) and without the assistance of generative AI backed by LLMs including, but not limited to, ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and all other text/code generators. All material that is assigned to students is meant to instill lasting critical thinking and problem solving skills that are required to excel in both this course and wherever students may end up in the future. As such, usage of these tools in a fashion akin to plagiarism (not citing, wholesale copying, intent to hide sources) is strictly prohibited in this course. All incidents that can be proven must be brought to the dean and always results in a zero on the grade. This goes for plagiarizing code from other sources, such as StackOverflow, Reddit, Github, other uncited sources, and fellow students.

That being said, using other sources as reference is not completely out of the question. Peers, tutorials, YouTube videos, existing code, and even LLMs can greatly aid in understanding complex topics. However, they cannot be used without disclosure and proper citation if being used extensively in an assignment. Use other sources and LLMs cautiously as this course is based on the lessons found within the the lectures given in-person.

## Policy on Submission of Assignments

All assignments will be submitted via Brightspace in the appropriate location identified by each assignment. Specific instructions can be found on the course website.
Each assignment will be given with an intended due date attached. For each day late an assignment is, a 10% reduction will be removed from the maximum possible grade, capped at 50%, so long as a valid final submission has been made by the end of the semester.

## Policy on Missed Classes, Make-up Work, and/or Extra Credit:

There is no method of attendance other than the attendance quizzes given weekly

## Cancellation of Classes Due to Inclement Weather or Other Emergency:

SUNY Poly has a 24-hour hotline, called Snowline, to inform students, faculty, and staff when severe weather prompts the cancellation of all classes. Snowline can be reached by calling 315-792-7385. In the event of severe weather, Snowline will announce only the cancellation of ALL classes. The cancellation of all classes will also be posted online and broadcast on radio and television stations in the Utica Rome and Syracuse areas. The SUNY Poly website also maintains a list of individual class cancellations.

In addition, all SUNY Poly students and employees are enrolled in the Rave Alert emergency alert service. You can visit the SUNY Poly Rave Alert website to learn more and to adjust your notification preferences.
