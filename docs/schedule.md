### **DISCLAIMER**
This schedule will be primarily used as a history of topics that we have covered thus far, as well as a short look into the future. To best attend to the class' pace, future looks will be limited to 1-2 weeks ahead with all due dates known when assignments are given and quiz/test dates when they are announced. Any changes made to significant dates will be in the students favor, if they happen.
